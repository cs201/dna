        <h1> Overview of LinkStrand Methods</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        Because LinkStrand implements the IDnaStrand interface, all the methods you are overriding are documented with comments, so you should check there if you are wondering how any methods should work. You can also refer to the working methods in SimpleStrand, although they will differ in implementation because they use a StringBuilder instead of a linked list. Make sure you correctly implement every method specified in the interface. Below are some considerations for you as you begin to code
        </p>

      <ul> 
          Constructor and initializeFrom:
          <li>Implement both with the same code (either copy the code or re-use the common code in one method)</li>
          <li>When creating/initializing a new LinkStrand only one node should be created. This node represents the entire string representation of DNA.</li>
          <li>Be sure to initialize the length of the simulated strand.</li>
          <li> Note: DNA Benchmark requires LinkStrand to have an empty constructor, ie. <br> <code> 
            public LinkStrand(){ this(""); }</code></li>
      </ul>

      <ul> 
        Append:
        <li>Implementation should not concatenate strings, but instead create new nodes</li>
        <li>If you’re appending a LinkStrand you should create new nodes; you should not convert the strand to a string.</li>
        <li>If you're appending another type of Strand, ie. a SimpleStrand, you should convert the strand to a string and then append it, you can refer to the implementation in Simple Strand. (Hint: the instanceof operator will be helpful)</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        CutandSplice:
        <li> You may assume there is only one node (though it may contain a huge String of DNA). If there is more than one node throw an exception, ex. <code>
          if(myFirst.next != null)) {throw new RuntimeException("link strand has more than one node")}; </code> </li>
        <li> The implementation of this method should be virtually identical to the code in SimpleStrand except you'll be creating LinkStrand objects and calling LinkStrand.append to create the recombinant strand.</li>
        <li>Virtually identical means you simply replace SimpleStrand objects with LinkStrand objects and then the code should work. (Refer to the code in SimpleStrand to help you.)</li>
        <li> The diagram below gives an indication as to why the operation of splicing in a new strand will be O(B) for cutting at B places. The string splicee is the same for all of the Nodes being spliced in. Creating the node is therefore O(1) because the String splicee is already created.</li>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        Reverse: 
        <li> The SimpleStrand class uses the StringBuilder.reverse() method to reverse the simulated strand – note that this method is a mutator - it changes the StringBuider object it’s called on. </li> 
        <li> In your LinkStrand class you can call .toString(), create a StringBuilder, and use .reverse() to create a single node LinkStrand object. </li>
        <li> For full credit an N-node list should be reversed with an N-node list. </li>
        <li> For extra credit you should only reverse each unique string in the list once. This means that if a string/simulated strand of DNA has been spliced into a LinkStrand object the string should only be reversed/represented once. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        Size:
        <li> Once the string is initialized, the length of a LinkStrand object should be calculated in O(1) time. Consider how you change the size of a strand in other methods. </li>
      </ul>
